Objectives: To use an API right, you need to read and understand the API documentation. This will give you a clear outline of what is needed to successfully make an API request, while further manipulating the response object. Especially, in TypeScript, knowing the structure of the request and response object allows you to design types or interfaces.

Instructions:

Create a New Project Directory:
Create a new project repository named alx-project-0x14.

Create README.md:
Create a README.md file in the root directory of your project.

Review API Documentation:
Visit the MoviesDatabase API documentation and review the available endpoints and features.

Add API Overview:
In your README.md, add a heading using ## for the API overview. Summarize the key features of the API in your own words.

Add API Version:
Below the API overview heading, add another heading using ## for version and state the version from the API documentation.

List Available Endpoints:
Create a section titled ## Available Endpoints and list the main endpoints available in the API along with a brief description of each.

Describe Request and Response Format:
Add a section titled ## Request and Response Format detailing the structure of a typical request and the corresponding response object. Use examples from the documentation.

Authentication Requirements:
Create a section titled ## Authentication and describe how to authenticate your requests (e.g., API key, headers required).

Error Handling:
Include a section titled ## Error Handling where you explain common error responses from the API and how to handle them in your code.

Usage Limits and Best Practices:
Add a final section titled ## Usage Limits and Best Practices that outlines any usage limitations (e.g., rate limits) and recommendations for effectively using the API.
